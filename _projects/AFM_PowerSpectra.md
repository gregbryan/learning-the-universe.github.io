This year saw the completion of a wide range of dark matter accelerated forward models, learning from numerical training sets and enabling the advanced inference techniques employed by the collaboration. This  included an exceptionally precise learned symbolic emulator for the linear power spectrum {% cite 2024A&A...686A.209B %} and for the non-linear power spectrum {% cite 2024A&A...686A.150B %} (SYREN-HALOFIT).
