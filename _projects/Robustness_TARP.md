Assessing the accuracy of posteriors from generative model inference is not straightforward. We have developed a new technique, Tests of Accuracy with Random Points (TARP), to estimate coverage probabilities of generative posterior estimators. Our method differs from previously-existing coverage-based methods, which require posterior evaluations. We have shown that our approach is necessary and sufficient for testing posterior estimator accuracy {% cite 2023PMLR..20219256L %}.
